<th><p>My name is Seth Johnson and I am a computing student at THE University of North Florida. I am
majoring in Information Technology. I am in my final year and plan to graduate in April of 2018 *cough* in three years *cough*.
I grew up in Melbourne, Florida but was born in Los Gatos, California, which is just outside of San
Jose.</p>

<p>Currently, my career choice is in a sort of limbo. I just finished an internship in the summer
of 2017 with Everbank working in their Information Security Operations department, and I learned a
lot. I also learned that, while security really intrigues me, it may or may not be what I want to do,
you know, for the rest of my life. I actually so far have really enjoyed web development and, though
I am new at it, I am considering what I can do with frontend web development career-wise. I know I
haven't done any javascript, PHP, or much SQL yet, but so far I have really liked where this is going.
It is different from other programming to me because I have some creative freedom to make things
exactly how I want them to work and look, and I really like my freedom.</p>

<p>I have also explored a career in law enforcement, and how I could possibly integrate my degree
choice with it. That has lead me to something even different in data mining with a program called
Splunk. I recently obtained my user certification in Splunk, and look to continue my education with
the tool in order to provide a significant value to any organization. If anyone has any ideas on
where I could branch out in this field, please reach out because I could use the help!</p>
